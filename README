wai - where am i - vim plugin
-----------------------------

A simple plugin to show the current location when editing a structured file
format. Currently only xml/html and supported.

When editing mustache or json files I sometimes lose track of the hierarchy.
This plugin aims at solving this by echo'ing the current 'path' from the
start of the document to the cursor.
